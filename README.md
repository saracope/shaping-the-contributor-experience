Abstract: At the end of the government shutdown, Sara found herself as the single developer responsible for more than 20 open source projects. To keep everything afloat, she needed help from the open source community. This talk will dive in to how to stay sane when youâ€™re a solo team member, conducting usability research on your open source projects and crafting an intentional contributor experience to grow your community.
