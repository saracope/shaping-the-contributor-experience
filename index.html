                      <p>code.gov was created as a result of the release of the Federal Source Code Policy in August of 2016. </p>

      <p>The federal source code policy required agencies to open source at least 20% of that code and so <a href="http://code.gov" target="_blank">code.gov</a> was created as a part of that to help agencies showcase that code to other agencies as well as outside contributors. </p>

                      <p>I joined the code.gov team about a year ago at the end of summer in 2018. Here we are at a hackathon we co-hosted for George Washington University students. We actually did several hackathons last year and at those events we noticed some issues folks had when trying to contribute the <a href="http://code.gov" target="_blank">code.gov</a> platform.</p>

            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>Event participants had several issues when trying to contribute to the code.gov platform:</p>

      <p>- Not sure where to begin</p>

      <p>- Couldn’t get the site running locally at all</p>

      <p>- Didn’t know they needed to get an API key</p>

      <p>- Couldn’t figure out where to make style changes</p>

      <p>- Would enter issues & PR’s on the wrong repo</p>

                      <p>During this same time we were working on re-platforming the site from Angular to React. So there was a lot going on for us. While we definitely talked about the issues we saw, we didn’t really prioritize the contributor experience right away. In November of 2018 we beta launched code.gov on React.</p>

                      <p>The following month we were forced to stop work. This lasted for 35 days. That’s 5 weeks or 10% of our year gone.</p>

      <p>When we returned to work after those 5 weeks, we didn’t do so as a full team. The 2 other engineers for code.gov, the ones who were originally there when I started, had moved on. So I went from being on an engineering to being the engineering team.</p>

                      <p>And while I was super excited to be back to work, to say I was panicked would be a massive understatement. I didn’t even work on code.gov full-time. At one point, I was working on 3 other projects in addition to this one. Plus, I didn’t have a ton of experience in React before joining the team.</p>

                      <p>And that’s why we wanted to focus on the contributor experience so that the platform (and I) had more support.</p>

      <p>I knew right off the bat that I had to take a step back focus on the small things. I asked myself what can I do now to create a better tomorrow? A lot of the time that meant adding test or a small automation.</p>

      <p>I was also sure to keep advocating for additional team members and ask for help when I needed to.</p>

      <p>As with anything, it’s also important to give yourself grace. My work is open source using a version control system. Sometimes I had to remind myself that if I didn’t manage to burn it all down, it could always be restored to the previous version.</p>

                      <p>I’m so thankful that code.gov is an open source project that anyone can contribute to. Because of this the 2 staff that left were still able to contribute and help out in their free time after they had left the team and their GSA access had been removed. This allowed us to more easily transition team members. Because we had an open community, they were able to rejoin our Slack as alumni and continue to be involved.</p>

                      <p>Right away we put a freeze on new feature development to focus on feeling stable and confident with the platform. We had to make sure that if we did nothing else, we addressed any security vulnerabilities as they came up.  We started to add more tests to build more trust with the platform. And then really started to focus on the contributor experience.</p>

                      <p>The biggest barrier to contribution is an inactive project or community. Per one interviewee, “if I see a project hasn’t been modified for a year, I don’t see a point of interacting with it because it’s probably not being used anymore.” </p>

                      <p>For a while we’d been tracking the basic engagement stats. Issues, PR’s, stars, forks. After diving a bit deeper into what was happening to our repos we decided to expand these. So we started tracking internal team vs. external contributor issues and pull requests. We started looking at how long issues have been open and if they’ve gone stale. How long is it taking us to close issues and PR’s.</p>

Our first experiment with this was in September of this year and we plan on doing continuously interview users once a month starting in 2020.</p>

                      <p>At the end of the day, it has been really hard working on such an important project without a huge engineering team. But I’m so glad to have the support of the open source community to keep it moving forward. As a team we’ll continue to focus on small incremental change every day because that’s what public service is all about.</p>

                      <p>We work in public service because we get the chance to work hard at work worth doing.</p>

      <p>So I thank those people who’ve walked with me on this journey. And I thank you for your time today.</p>
